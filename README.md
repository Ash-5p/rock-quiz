This project is an interactive rock/guitar based quiz called "String Theory". It is intended to provide a fun, replayable experience to the user by offering a random selection of 10 questions from a possible 54. The quiz uses an unconventional scoring sytem, in which the player gains points equal to the amount of time left on the clock, further encouraging them to play again.

## UX

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

The color scheme of bright red and wheat is inspired by the appearence of a [vintage 50's Fender Stratocaster](documentation/readme/fender-strat.webp), and wheat coloring aims to emulate the yellowish color of old plastic like that seen on the pickups and tone/volume knobs. The

### Colour Scheme

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

⚠️ ONLY IF YOU ACTUALLY ADDED `:root` variables in CSS! ⚠️
If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
