This project is an interactive rock/guitar based quiz called "String Theory". It is intended to provide a fun, replayable experience to the user by offering a random selection of 10 questions from a possible 50+. The quiz uses an unconventional scoring sytem, in which the player gains points equal to the amount of time left on the clock, further encouraging them to play again.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme is inspired by the appearence of a [vintage 50's Fender Stratocaster](documentation/readme/fender-strat.webp), and wheat coloring aims to emulate the yellowish color of old plastic like that seen on the pickups and tone/volume knobs.

- `#f5deb3` used for primary text.
- `#d8290a` used for primary highlights.
- `#00000f` used for secondary text.
- `#322b2b` used for secondary highlights.
- `#f5deb3` used for text background.
- `#322b2b` used for navigation button background.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/d8290a-00000f-f5deb3-322b2b) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [RocknRoll One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/RocknRoll+One) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [New Rocker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/New+Rocker) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
